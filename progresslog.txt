✗ Right now GNU grep doesn't accept filepaths in its excludes. If grepf detects a user doing that, switch to 'find . -exec grep' instead rather than telling the user it can't be done
    find / -maxdepth 1 -xdev -type f -exec grep -i "stringtofind" -l {} \; -exec sed -i '/./d' {} \;

✓ Add support for ag

✗ Add support for rg

✓ Allow user to specify which grepprg to use by exporting the $GREPF environment variable: either rg, ag or grep.
    grep will always default to system grep, meaning BSD for macOS and GNU for Linux, even if the user has installed the other grep variant.
